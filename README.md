[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/kmermaid/) | [docs](https://ggirelli.github.io/kmermaid/)

`kmermaid` is a Python3.8+ package containing tools for selection of complementary oligonucleotides to build iFISH probes. It is based on our previous `ifpd` package, but works with a different and more detailed database format, allowing for more precise control on the probe design process. Read the online [documentation](https://ggirelli.github.io/kmermaid/) for more details.

## Requirements

`kmermaid` is fully implemented in Python3.8+, thus you need the corresponding Python version to run it. Check out [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) how to install Python+ on your machine if you don't have it yet.

`kmermaid` has been tested with Python 3.8 and 3.9. We recommend installing it using `pipx` (see [below](https://github.com/ggirelli/kmermaid#installation)) to avoid dependency conflicts with other packages. The packages it depends on are listed in our [dependency graph](https://github.com/ggirelli/kmermaid/network/dependencies). We use [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to handle our dependencies.

## Installation

We recommend installing `kmermaid` using [`pipx`](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx). Check how to install `pipx` [here](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx#install-pipx) if you don't have it yet!

Once you have `pipx` ready on your system, install the latest stable release of `kmermaid` by running: `pipx install kmermaid`. If you see the stars (âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨), then the installation went well!

## Usage

All `kmermaid` commands are accessible via the `kmer` keyword on the terminal. For each command, you can access its help page by using the `-h` option. More details on how to run `kmermaid` are available in the online [documentation](https://ggirelli.github.io/kmermaid).
